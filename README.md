# character-vision
Using deep learning to recognize characters and digits in random scenarios similar to Google Streetview house number identification but more generic.

## Objective
To use Deep Learning to identify and recognize characters in any random scenario by only using generated data.

## Data
The quality of a deep learning model depends to a large extend on the quality of the data set used for training. Quality data sets are hard to come by, and has rightly been called the new *GOLD*. Being able to augment existing data and to generate new data if it hasn't already will become an important tool. The main objective of this project is to solve a complicated real world problem only solely using generated data. 


## Model
### Architecture
Einstein:
> Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.  

Adopting Einstein's quote and changing it slightly for deep learning:

> Your model should be made as simple as possible, but as deep as needed.


### Fine tuning



## Training
### Over-fitting
