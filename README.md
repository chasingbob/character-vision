# character-vision
Using deep learning to recognize characters and digits in random scenarios similar to Google Streetview house number identification but more generic.

## Objective
To use Deep Learning to identify and recognize characters in any random scenario by only using generated data.

## Data
The quality of a deep learning model depends largely on the quality of the data set. And quality data sets are hard to come by, and has rightly been called the GOLD of modern times. With that in mind I have set my self the challenge of training a deep learning model that performs well in real world scenarios but trained solely on generated data. 

## The model
### Model architecture
Einstein:
> Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.  

Adopting Einstein's quote and changing it slightly for deep learning:

> Your model should be made as simple as possible, but as deep as needed.
